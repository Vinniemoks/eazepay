## 🎯 Implementation Approach

Given the scope (100+ files needed), here's the recommended approach:

### Option 1: Incremental Implementation (Recommended)
Implement one complete flow at a time:

**Week 1-2**: Customer Registration & Login
- Shared components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Registration screens (4 screens)
- Login screens (2 screens)
- Authentication logic

**Week 3-4**: Customer Wallet & Transactions
- Dashboard screen
- Send money flow (5 screens)
- Transaction history
- QR code features

**Week 5-6**: Agent Features
- Agent registration
- Agent dashboard
- Customer service flows
- Float management

**Week 7-8**: Admin Features
- Admin dashboard
- User management
- Transaction monitoring
- Agent management

**Week 9-10**: Superuser Features
- System configuration
- Admin management
- Analytics & reporting

**Week 11-12**: Polish & Testing
- Offline mode
- Push notifications
- Testing
- Performance optimization

### Option 2: Component-First Approach
Build all shared components first, then assemble screens:

**Week 1**: Shared Component Library
- All buttons, inputs, cards, lists, modals
- Navigation components
- Feedback components

**Week 2-12**: Feature Implementation
- Use pre-built components to rapidly build screens
- Focus on business logic and API integration

## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option A: Start with Working Prototype
Use the existing basic implementations and enhance them:

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Basic mobile app structure exists
- ✅ Basic desktop app structure exists
- ✅ Authentication screens created
- ✅ Wallet screen created
- ✅ Send money screen created

**Next Steps**:
1. Enhance existing screens with full design
2. Add missing screens (registration, QR, etc.)
3. Implement agent/admin/superuser features
4. Add offline mode and notifications

### Option B: Fresh Implementation
Start from scratch with the complete specification:

1. Set up project structure
2. Create shared component library
3. Implement customer flows
4. Implement agent flows
5. Implement admin flows
6. Implement superuser flows
7. Add cross-platform features
8. Test and polish

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Best Approach**: Hybrid - Enhance existing + Add new

1. **Keep existing code** (mobile-app/, desktop-app/)
2. **Enhance with specification**:
   - Add missing components
   - Complete all screens
   - Implement all stakeholder flows
3. **Add new features**:
   - Agent features
   - Admin features
   - Superuser features
   - Offline mode
   - Push notifications

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks with 2-3 developers

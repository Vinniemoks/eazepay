- Job types:
  - Daily reconciliation (2 AM)
  - Weekly report generation (Sundays 6 AM)
  - Data migration
  - Compliance checks
- Retry logic with configurable attempts
- Job status tracking and monitoring

### 3. **Document Processor** (`document-processor.ts`)
- OCR text extraction using Tesseract.js
- KYC document processing:
  - National ID parsing and validation
  - Passport parsing and validation
  - Driving license parsing and validation
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, normalize, sharpen)
- Confidence scoring
- Data extraction and validation

### 4. **Biometric Station** (`biometric-station.ts`)
- Biometric enrollment (fingerprint, face, iris, voice)
- Biometric verification with confidence scoring
- Template quality assessment
- Multiple biometric types per user
- Match score calculation (80% threshold)
- Template management (add, verify, delete)

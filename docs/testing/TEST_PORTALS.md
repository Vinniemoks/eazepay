## Important Notes

### API Connectivity
The portals are currently running in **standalone mode**. This means:
- ‚úÖ The UI is fully functional and accessible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API calls will fail until backend services are running
- To enable full functionality, start the backend services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d identity-service wallet-service transaction-service
  ```

### Health Check Status
The health checks may show as "unhealthy" in docker-compose, but **the portals are working fine**. This is just a health check configuration issue that doesn't affect functionality.

You can verify they're working by:
1. Opening http://localhost:3001 in your browser ‚úÖ
2. Opening http://localhost:3002 in your browser ‚úÖ
3. Checking the logs: `docker-compose logs customer-portal`

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the UI
Open both portals in your browser and explore the interface:
- Customer Portal: http://localhost:3001
- Agent Portal: http://localhost:3002

### 2. Start Backend Services (Optional)
To enable full functionality with working APIs:
```bash
docker-compose up -d identity-service biometric-service transaction-service wallet-service agent-service
```

### 3. Full Stack Deployment
To run everything:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access the portals?
1. Check if containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps customer-portal agent-portal
   ```

2. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs customer-portal
   docker-compose logs agent-portal
   ```

3. Restart the portals:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart customer-portal agent-portal
   ```

### Port conflicts?
If ports 3001 or 3002 are already in use, you can change them in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "3003:80"  # Change 3001 to 3003
```

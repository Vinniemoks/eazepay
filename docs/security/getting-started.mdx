# Getting Started with the Eazepay API

Welcome to the Eazepay API! This guide will walk you through the first steps to making your first API call.

## 1. Obtain Your API Keys

First, you'll need to sign up for an Eazepay developer account. Once you're logged in, navigate to the "API Keys" section of your developer dashboard.

You will find two keys:
- **Public Key**: `pk_test_...` - Used for client-side operations.
- **Secret Key**: `sk_test_...` - Used for server-side API calls. Keep this key secure!

## 2. Authentication

All server-side API requests must be authenticated using your **Secret Key**. Include it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```bash
curl https://api.eazepay.com/v1/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

## 3. Making Your First Payment

Now you're ready to create your first payment. Check out the API Reference for the full details on the `/transactions` endpoint.

# Infrastructure Configuration Assets

The Docker Compose definition wires up a comprehensive development environment. This repository now includes the
configuration assets that the stack expects so you can boot it locally without volume-mount errors.

## API Gateway (NGINX)
- The primary gateway configuration lives at `infrastructure/docker/nginx/nginx.conf`. It defines upstreams for each service,
  enforces basic security headers, exposes a `/health` endpoint, and includes the per-route files under `conf.d`.
- Self-signed development TLS assets reside in `infrastructure/docker/nginx/ssl`. Replace `certificate.crt` and `private.key`
  with environment-specific certificates before deploying outside of local development.
- Additional server snippets continue to live under `infrastructure/docker/nginx/conf.d`, including
  `default.conf` for health/status endpoints.

## RabbitMQ
- RabbitMQ now loads `infrastructure/docker/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`, which configures the default admin credentials, virtual
  host, logging, Prometheus metrics listener, and basic resource limits expected by the docker-compose stack.
- Exchange, queue, and permission bootstrapping remains managed by `infrastructure/docker/rabbitmq/definitions.json`. You can
  customise this file to provision additional messaging topology.
  
## Web Portal (Front-end shell)
- The `web-portal` service bundles a static application shell in `services/web-portal/public` that reflects the AfriPay brand
  palette (blue and gold) and provides an instant UI scaffold for integration testing.
- Its Docker image (`services/web-portal/Dockerfile`) bakes the assets into an NGINX container with a `/health` endpoint, and
  the API gateway reverse proxies requests hitting `app.afripay.local` to this service.
- Log output is persisted to the `web_portal_logs` volume so you can inspect HTTP traffic while developing against the UI.

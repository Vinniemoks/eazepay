AfriPay Universal - Architecture Overview
System Architecture
AfriPay Universal is built using a microservices architecture designed for high availability, scalability, and security.
Core Principles

Microservices Architecture: Independent, loosely coupled services
Event-Driven Communication: Asynchronous messaging for resilience
Security-First: Zero-trust architecture with encryption at rest and in transit
Multi-Channel Support: USSD, Mobile App, Agent Terminals
Offline-First: Local processing with eventual consistency

Notifications → SMS/Push → User
Security Architecture

API Gateway: Rate limiting, authentication, routing
Service-to-Service: mTLS, JWT tokens
Data Encryption: AES-256 for sensitive data
Biometric Templates: Zero-knowledge storage
Audit Logging: All transactions logged immutably

Deployment Architecture

Development: Docker Compose
Production: Kubernetes on AWS/Azure
Database: PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache, MongoDB analytics
Message Queue: RabbitMQ for event streaming
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

Scalability Design

Horizontal Scaling: Auto-scaling pods in Kubernetes
Database Sharding: User-based partitioning
Caching Strategy: Multi-layer (L1: Memory, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
Load Balancing: Round-robin with health checks
